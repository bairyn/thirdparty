  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Destroys the records matching <tt>conditions</tt> by instantiating each record and calling their <tt>destroy</tt> method. This means at least 2*N database queries to destroy N records, so avoid <tt>destroy_all</tt> if you are deleting many records. If you want to simply delete records without worrying about dependent associations or callbacks, use the much faster <tt>delete_all</tt> method instead.
