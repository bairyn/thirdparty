    body: override to filter out system tables that otherwise end up in db/schema.rb during migrations. JdbcConnection#tables now takes an optional block filter so we can screen out rows corresponding to system tables. HSQLDB names its system tables SYSTEM.*, but H2 seems to name them without any kind of convention
