    body: Generate a random number, doing a little extra work to make it more likely that it's suitable for cryptography. If your system doesn't have /dev/urandom then this number is not cryptographically safe. See &lt;http://www.cosine.org/2007/08/07/security-ruby-kernel-rand/&gt; for more information. max is the largest possible value of such a random number, where the result will be less than max.
