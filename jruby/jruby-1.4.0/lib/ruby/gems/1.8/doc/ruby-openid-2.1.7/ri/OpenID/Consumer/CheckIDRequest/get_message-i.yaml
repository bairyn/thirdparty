    body: Not specifying a return_to URL means that the user will not be returned to the site issuing the request upon its completion.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: If immediate mode is requested, the OpenID provider is to send back a response immediately, useful for behind-the-scenes authentication attempts. Otherwise the OpenID provider may engage the user before providing a response. This is the default case, as the user may need to provide credentials or approve the request before a positive response can be sent.
