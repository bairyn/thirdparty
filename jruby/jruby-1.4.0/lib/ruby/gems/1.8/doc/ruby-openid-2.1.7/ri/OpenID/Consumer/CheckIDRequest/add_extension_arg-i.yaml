    body: Add an extension argument to this OpenID authentication request. You probably want to use add_extension and the OpenID::Extension interface.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Use caution when adding arguments, because they will be URL-escaped and appended to the redirect URL, which can easily get quite long.
