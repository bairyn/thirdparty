  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: The simple registration namespace was not found and could not be created using the expected name (there's another extension using the name 'sreg')
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: This is not <em>illegal</em>, for OpenID 2, although it probably indicates a problem, since it's not expected that other extensions will re-use the alias that is in use for OpenID 1.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: If this is an OpenID 1 request, then there is no recourse. This should not happen unless some code has modified the namespaces for the message that is being processed.
