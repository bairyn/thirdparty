      <h1><a href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a></h1>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a> is a gem to make a .war file
out of a Rails, Merb, or Rack-based application. The intent is to provide a
minimal, flexible, ruby-like way to bundle up all of your application files
for deployment to a Java application server.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a> provides a sane set of
out-of-the box defaults that should allow most Rails applications without
external gem dependencies (aside from Rails itself) to assemble and Just
Work.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a> bundles JRuby and the
JRuby-Rack servlet adapter for dispatching requests to your application
inside the java application server, and assembles all jar files in
WARBLER_HOME/lib/*.jar into your application. No external dependencies are
downloaded.
</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
<li>Install the gem: <tt>gem install warbler</tt>.

</li>
<li>Run warbler in the top directory of your Rails application:
<tt>warble</tt>.

</li>
<li>Deploy your railsapp.war file to your favorite Java application server.

</li>
</ol>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a>&#8216;s <tt>warble</tt>
command is just a small wrapper around Rake with internally defined tasks.
(Notice &quot;rake&quot; still prints out in the message, but you should
substitute &quot;warble&quot; for &quot;rake&quot; on the command line when
running this way.)
</p>
<pre>
   $ warble -T
   rake config         # Generate a configuration file to customize your war assembly
   rake pluginize      # Unpack warbler as a plugin in your Rails application
   rake war            # Create trunk.war
   rake war:app        # Copy all application files into the .war
   rake war:clean      # Clean up the .war file and the staging area
   rake war:gems       # Unpack all gems into WEB-INF/gems
   rake war:jar        # Run the jar command to create the .war
   rake war:java_libs  # Copy all java libraries into the .war
   rake war:public     # Copy all public HTML files to the root of the .war
   rake war:webxml     # Generate a web.xml file for the webapp
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a> makes heavy use of
Rake&#8216;s file and directory tasks, so only recently updated files will
be copied, making repeated assemblies much faster.
</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<h3>Rails applications</h3>
<p>
Rails applications are detected automatically and configured appropriately.
The following items are set up for you:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The Rails gem is packaged if you haven&#8216;t vendored Rails.

</li>
<li>Other gems configured in Rails.configuration.gems are packaged (Rails 2.1
or later)

</li>
<li>Multi-thread-safe execution (as introduced in Rails 2.2) is detected and
runtime pooling is disabled.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Merb applications</h3>
<p>
Merb applications are detected automatically, and the merb-core gem and its
dependencies are packaged.
</p>
<h3>Other Rack-based applications</h3>
<p>
If you have a &#8216;config.ru&#8217; file in the top directory of your
application, its contents will be used as the rackup script for your
Rack-based application. You will probably need to specify framework and
application gems in config/warble.rb.
</p>
<p>
See &lt;a href=&quot;<a
href="http://jruby-rack.kenai.com/sources/main/show/examples">the">jruby-rack.kenai.com/sources/main/show/examples">the</a>
examples in the jruby-rack project&lt;/a&gt; of how to configure <a
href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a> to package Camping and Sinatra
apps.
</p>
<h3>Configuration auto-detect notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you don&#8216;t have database access in the environment where you
package your application, you may wish to set `Warbler.framework_detection`
to false at the top of config.rb. In this case you may need to specify
additional details such as booter, gems and other settings.

</li>
<li>A more accurate way of detecting a Merb application&#8216;s gems is needed.
Until then, you will have to specify them in config/warble.rb. See below.

</li>
<li>Is it possible to more generally detect what gems an application uses?
Gem.loaded_specs is available, but the application needs to be loaded first
before its contents are reliable.

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Custom configuration</h3>
<p>
The default configuration puts application files (<tt>app</tt>,
<tt>config</tt>, <tt>lib</tt>, <tt>log</tt>, <tt>vendor</tt>, <tt>tmp</tt>)
under the .war file&#8216;s WEB-INF directory, and files in <tt>public</tt>
in the root of the .war file. Any Java .jar files stored in lib will
automatically be placed in WEB-INF/lib for placement on the web app&#8216;s
classpath.
</p>
<p>
If the default settings are not appropriate for your application, you can
customize <a href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a>&#8216;s behavior.
To customize files, libraries, and gems included in the .war file,
you&#8216;ll need a config/warble.rb file. There a two ways of doing this.
With the gem, simply run
</p>
<pre>
    warble config
</pre>
<p>
If you have <a href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a> installed as a
plugin, use the generator:
</p>
<pre>
 script/generate warble
</pre>
<p>
Finally, edit the config/warble.rb to your taste. If you install the gem
but later decide you&#8216;d like to have it as a plugin, use the
<tt>pluginize</tt> command:
</p>
<pre>
    warble pluginize
</pre>
<p>
If you wish to upgrade or switch one or more java libraries from
what&#8216;s bundled in the <a href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a>
gem, simply change the jars in WARBLER_HOME/lib, or modify the
<tt>java_libs</tt> attribute of <a
href="../classes/Warbler/Config.html">Warbler::Config</a> to include the
files you need.
</p>
<p>
Once <a href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a> is installed as a
plugin, you can use <tt>rake</tt> to build the war (with the same set of
tasks as above).
</p>
<p>
The generated config/warble.rb file is fully-documented with the available
options and default values.
</p>
<h3>Web.xml</h3>
<p>
Java web applications are configured mainly through this file, and <a
href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a> creates a suitable default file
for you for use. However, if you need to customize it in any way, you have
two options.
</p>
<ol>
<li>If you just want a static web.xml file whose contents you manually control,
you may copy the one generated for you in <tt>tmp/war/WEB-INF/web.xml</tt>
to <tt>config/web.xml</tt> and modify as needed. It will be copied into the
webapp for you.

</li>
<li>If you want to inject some dynamic information into the file, copy the
<tt>WARBLER_HOME/web.xml.erb</tt> to <tt>config/web.xml.erb</tt>. Its
contents will be evaluated for you and put in the webapp. Note that you can
also pass arbitrary properties to the ERb template by setting
<tt>config.webxml.customkey</tt> values in your <tt>config/warble.rb</tt>
file.

</li>
</ol>
<p>
For more information on configuration, see <a
href="../classes/Warbler/Config.html">Warbler::Config</a>.
</p>
<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
<p>
If <a href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a> isn&#8216;t packaging the
files you were expecting, there are several debug tasks available to give
you more insight into what&#8216;s going on.
</p>
<ul>
<li><tt>war:debug</tt> prints a YAML dump of the current configuration

</li>
<li><tt>war:debug:X</tt> prints a list of files that <a
href="../classes/Warbler.html">Warbler</a> will include during that stage
of assembly. Valid values of <tt>X</tt> are <tt>app, java_libs, gems,
public, includes, excludes</tt>.

</li>
</ul>
