        body: The CSS selectors for this rule, parsed for commas and parent-references. It's only set once {Tree::Node#perform} has been called.
      - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
        body: It's an array of arrays of arrays. The first level of arrays represents distinct lines in the Sass file; the second level represents comma-separated selectors; the third represents structure within those selectors, currently only parent-refs (represented by `:parent`). For example,
      - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
        body: "    &amp;.foo, bar, baz,\n    bip, &amp;.bop, bup\n"

        body: would be
      - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
        body: "    [[[:parent, &quot;foo&quot;], [&quot;bar&quot;], [&quot;baz&quot;]],\n     [[&quot;bip&quot;], [:parent, &quot;bop&quot;], [&quot;bup&quot;]]]\n"
