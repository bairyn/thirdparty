# <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> and <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a>
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> and <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> are templating engines for the two
most common types of documents on the web: HTML and CSS, respectively. They
are designed to make it both easier and more pleasant to code HTML and CSS
documents, by eliminating redundancy, reflecting the underlying structure
that the document represents, and providing elegant, easily understandable,
and powerful syntax.
</p>
<p>
## Using
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> and <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> can be used from the command line or
as part of a Ruby web framework. The first step is to install the gem:
</p>
<pre>
    gem install haml
</pre>
<p>
After you convert some HTML to <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> or
some CSS to <a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a>, you can run
</p>
<pre>
    haml document.haml
    sass style.sass
</pre>
<p>
to compile them. For more information on these commands, check out
</p>
<pre>
    haml --help
    sass --help
</pre>
<p>
To install <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> and <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> as a Rails plugin, just run `haml
&#8212;rails path/to/rails/app` and both <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> and <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> will be installed. Views with the
`.html.haml` extension will automatically use <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a>. <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> is a little more complicated; `.sass`
files should be placed in `public/stylesheets/sass`, where they&#8216;ll be
automatically compiled to corresponding CSS files in `public/stylesheets`
when needed (the <a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> template directory
is customizable&#8230; see [the <a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a>
reference](<a
href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/SASS_REFERENCE.md.html#template_location-option">sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/SASS_REFERENCE.md.html#template_location-option</a>)
for details).
</p>
<p>
For <a href="../classes/Merb.html">Merb</a>, `.html.haml` views will work
without any further modification. To enable <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a>, you also need to add a dependency. To
do so, just add
</p>
<pre>
    dependency &quot;merb-haml&quot;
</pre>
<p>
to `config/dependencies.rb` (or `config/init.rb` in a flat/very flat <a
href="../classes/Merb.html">Merb</a> application). Then it&#8216;ll work
just like it does in Rails.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> can also be used with any
Rack-enabled web framework. To do so, just add
</p>
<pre>
    require 'sass/plugin/rack'
    use Sass::Plugin::Rack
</pre>
<p>
to `config.ru`. Then any <a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> files in
`public/stylesheets/sass` will be compiled CSS files in
`public/stylesheets` on every request.
</p>
<p>
To use <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> and <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> programatically, check out the [YARD
documentation](<a
href="http://haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc">haml-lang.com/docs/yardoc</a>/).
</p>
<p>
## Formatting
</p>
<p>
### <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a>
</p>
<p>
The most basic element of <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> is a
shorthand for creating HTML:
</p>
<pre>
    %tagname{:attr1 =&gt; 'value1', :attr2 =&gt; 'value2'} Contents
</pre>
<p>
No end-tag is needed; <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> handles that
automatically. If you prefer HTML-style attributes, you can also use:
</p>
<pre>
    %tagname(attr1='value1' attr2='value2') Contents
</pre>
<p>
Adding `class` and `id` attributes is even easier. <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> uses the same syntax as the CSS that
styles the document:
</p>
<pre>
    %tagname#id.class
</pre>
<p>
In fact, when you&#8216;re using the `&lt;div&gt;` tag, it becomes _even
easier_. Because `&lt;div&gt;` is such a common element, a tag without a
name defaults to a div. So
</p>
<pre>
    #foo Hello!
</pre>
<p>
becomes
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;div id='foo'&gt;Hello!&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> uses indentation to bring the
individual elements to represent the HTML structure. A tag&#8216;s children
are indented beneath than the parent tag. Again, a closing tag is
automatically added. For example:
</p>
<pre>
    %ul
      %li Salt
      %li Pepper
</pre>
<p>
becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Salt&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pepper&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
<p>
You can also put plain text as a child of an element:
</p>
<pre>
    %p
      Hello,
      World!
</pre>
<p>
It&#8216;s also possible to embed Ruby code into <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> documents. An equals sign, `=`, will
output the result of the code. A hyphen, `-`, will run the code but not
output the result. You can even use control statements like `if` and
`while`:
</p>
<pre>
    %p
      Date/Time:
      - now = DateTime.now
      %strong= now
      - if now &gt; DateTime.parse(&quot;December 31, 2006&quot;)
        = &quot;Happy new &quot; + &quot;year!&quot;
</pre>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> provides far more tools than those
presented here. Check out the reference documentation in the <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> module.
</p>
<p>
### <a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a>
</p>
<p>
At its most basic, <a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> is just another
way of writing CSS. Although it&#8216;s very much like normal CSS, the
basic syntax offers a few helpful features: indentation indicates the
properties in a rule, rather than non-DRY brackets; and newlines indicate
the end of a properties, rather than a semicolon. For example:
</p>
<pre>
    #main
      background-color: #f00
      width: 98%
</pre>
<p>
becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    #main {
      background-color: #f00;
      width: 98% }
</pre>
<p>
However, <a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> provides much more than a
way to make CSS look nice. In CSS, it&#8216;s important to have accurate
selectors, so your styles don&#8216;t just apply to everything. However, in
order to do this, you need to use nested element selectors. These get very
ugly very quickly. I&#8216;m sure everyone&#8216;s had to write something
like &quot;main .sidebar .top p h1 a&quot;, followed by &quot;main .sidebar
.top p h1 a:visited&quot; and &quot;main .sidebar .top p h1 a:hover&quot;.
Well, <a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> gets rid of that. Like <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a>, it uses indentation to indicate the
structure of the document. So, what was:
</p>
<pre>
    #main {
      width: 90%;
    }
    #main p {
      border-style: solid;
      border-width: 1px;
      border-color: #00f;
    }
    #main p a {
      text-decoration: none;
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    #main p a:hover {
      text-decoration: underline;
    }
</pre>
<p>
becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    #main
      width: 90%
      p
        border-style: solid
        border-width: 1px
        border-color: #00f
        a
          text-decoration: none
          font-weight: bold
        a:hover
          text-decoration: underline
</pre>
<p>
Pretty nice, no? Well, it gets better. One of the main complaints against
CSS is that it doesn&#8216;t allow variables. What if have a color or a
width you re-use all the time? In CSS, you just have to re-type it each
time, which is a nightmare when you decide to change it later. Not so for
<a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a>! You can use the `!` character to
set variables. Then, if you put `=` after your property name, you can set
it to a variable. For example:
</p>
<pre>
    !note_bg= #55aaff

    #main
      width: 70%
      .note
        background-color = !note_bg
      p
        width: 5em
        background-color = !note_bg
</pre>
<p>
becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    #main {
      width: 70%; }
      #main .note {
        background-color: #55aaff; }
      #main p {
        width: 5em;
        background-color: #55aaff; }
</pre>
<p>
You can even do simple arithmetic operations with variables, adding numbers
and even colors together:
</p>
<pre>
    !main_bg= #46ar12
    !main_width= 40em

    #main
      background-color = !main_bg
      width = !main_width
      .sidebar
        background-color = !main_bg + #333333
        width = !main_width - 25em
</pre>
<p>
becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    #main {
      background-color: #46a312;
      width: 40em; }
      #main .sidebar {
        background-color: #79d645;
        width: 15em; }
</pre>
<p>
Taking the idea of variables a bit further are mixins. These let you group
whole bunches of CSS properties into a single directive and then include
those anywhere you want:
</p>
<pre>
    =blue-border
      border:
        color: blue
        width: 2px
        style: dotted

    .comment
      +blue-border
      padding: 2px
      margin: 10px 0

    .reply
      +blue-border
</pre>
<p>
becomes:
</p>
<pre>
    .comment {
      border-color: blue;
      border-width: 2px;
      border-style: dotted;
      padding: 2px;
      margin: 10px 0;
    }

    .reply {
      border-color: blue;
      border-width: 2px;
      border-style: dotted;
    }
</pre>
<p>
A comprehensive list of features is in the documentation for the <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> module.
</p>
<p>
## Indentation
</p>
<p>
Indentation can be made up of one or more tabs or spaces. However,
indentation must be consistent within a given document. Hard tabs and
spaces can&#8216;t be mixed, and the same number of tabs or spaces must be
used throughout.
</p>
<p>
## Executables
</p>
<p>
The <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> gem includes several
executables that are useful for dealing with <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> and <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> from the command line.
</p>
<p>
### `haml`
</p>
<p>
The `haml` executable transforms a source <a
href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> file into HTML. See `haml &#8212;help`
for further information and options.
</p>
<p>
### `sass`
</p>
<p>
The `sass` executable transforms a source <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> file into CSS. See `sass &#8212;help`
for further information and options.
</p>
<p>
### `html2haml`
</p>
<p>
The `html2haml` executable attempts to transform HTML, optionally with ERB
markup, into <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a> code. Since HTML is so
variable, this transformation is not always perfect; it&#8216;s a good idea
to have a human check the output of this tool. See `html2haml &#8212;help`
for further information and options.
</p>
<p>
### `css2sass`
</p>
<p>
The `css2sass` executable attempts to transform CSS into <a
href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> code. This transformation attempts to
use <a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a> nesting where possible. See
`css2sass &#8212;help` for further information and options.
</p>

the author of the original implementation. However, Hampton doesn&#8216;t
even know his way around the code anymore and now occasionally consults on
the language issues. Hampton lives in Jacksonville, Florida and is the lead
mobile developer for Wikimedia.

implementation of <a href="../classes/Haml.html">Haml</a>. His hard work
has kept the project alive by endlessly answering forum posts, fixing bugs,
refactoring, finding speed improvements, writing documentation,
implementing new features, and getting Hampton coffee (a fitting task for a
boy-genius). Nathan lives in Seattle, Washington and while not being a
student at the University of Washington or working at an internship, he
consults for Unspace Interactive.

framework. Chris focuses on making <a href="../classes/Sass.html">Sass</a>
more powerful, easy to use, and on ways to speed its adoption through the
web development community. Chris lives in San Jose, California with his
wife and daughter. He is the Software Architect for [Caring.com](<a
href="http://caring.com">caring.com</a>), a website devoted to the 34

</p>
<p>
If you use this software, you must pay Hampton a compliment. And buy Nathan
some jelly beans. Maybe pet a kitten. Yeah. Pet that kitty.
