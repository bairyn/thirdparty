  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: A namespace for nodes in the Sass parse tree.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: The Sass parse tree has two states. When it's first parsed, it has nodes for mixin definitions and for loops and so forth, in addition to nodes for CSS rules and properties.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: However, {Tree::Node#perform} returns a different sort of tree. This tree maps more closely to the resulting CSS document than it does to the original Sass document. It still has nodes for CSS rules and properties, but it doesn't have any dynamic-generation-related nodes.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: Nodes that only appear in the pre-perform state are called **dynamic nodes**; those that appear in both states are called **static nodes**.
