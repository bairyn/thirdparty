<h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> is a rake/rubygems helper for project
Rakefiles. It helps you manage and maintain, and release your project and
includes a dynamic plug-in system allowing for easy extensibility. <a
href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> ships with plug-ins for all your usual
project tasks including rdoc generation, testing, packaging, and
deployment.
</p>
<p>
See class rdoc for help. Hint: `ri <a href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a>`
or any of the plugins listed below.
</p>
<p>
For extra goodness, see: <a
href="http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/hoe/Hoe.pdf">seattlerb.rubyforge.org/hoe/Hoe.pdf</a>
</p>
<h2>FEATURES/PROBLEMS:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Includes a dynamic plug-in system allowing for easy extensibility.

</li>
<li>Auto-intuits changes, description, summary, and version.

</li>
<li>Uses a manifest for safe and secure deployment.

</li>
<li>Provides &#8216;sow&#8217; for quick project directory creation.

</li>
<li>Sow uses a simple ERB templating system allowing you to capture your
project patterns.

</li>
</ul>
<h2>SYNOPSIS:</h2>
<pre>
  % sow [group] project
</pre>
<p>
(you can edit a project template in ~/.hoe_template after running sow for
the first time)
</p>
<p>
or:
</p>
<pre>
  require 'hoe'

  Hoe.spec projectname do
    # ... project specific data ...
  end

  # ... project specific tasks ...
</pre>
<h2>Deployment, the DRY way</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> focuses on keeping everything in its
place in a useful form and intelligently extracting what it needs. As a
result, there are no extra YAML files, config directories, ruby files, or
any other artifacts in your release that you wouldn&#8216;t already have.
</p>
<h3>Structure Overview</h3>
<pre>
  project_dir/
    History.txt
    Manifest.txt
    README.txt
    Rakefile
    bin/...
    lib/...
    test/...
</pre>
<h3>README.txt</h3>
<p>
Most projects have a readme file of some kind that describes the project.
<a href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> projects are no different, but we
take them one step further. The readme file points the reader towards all
the information they need to know to get started including a description,
relevant urls, code synopsis, license, etc. <a
href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> knows how to read a basic rdoc formatted
file to pull out the description (and summary by extension), urls, and
extra paragraphs of info you may want to provide in news/blog posts.
</p>
<h3>History.txt</h3>
<p>
Every project should have a document describing changes over time. <a
href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> can read this file (also in rdoc) and
include the latest changes in your announcements.
</p>
<h3>Manifest.txt</h3>
<p>
<em>&lt;strong&gt;manifest [noun]&lt;/strong&gt; a document giving
comprehensive details of a ship and its cargo and other contents,
passengers, and crew for the use of customs officers.</em>
</p>
<p>
Every project should know what it is shipping. This is done via an explicit
list of everything that goes out in a release. <a
href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> uses this during packaging so that
nothing embarrassing is picked up.
</p>
<p>
Imagine, you&#8216;re a customs inspector at the Los Angeles Port, the
world&#8216;s largest import/export port. A large ship filled to the brim
pulls up to the pier ready for inspection. You walk up to the captain and
his crew and ask &quot;what is the contents of this fine ship today&quot;
and the captain answers &quot;oh&#8230; whatever is inside&quot;. The mind
boggles. There is no way in the world that a professionally run ship would
ever run this way and there is no way that you should either.
</p>
<p>
Professional software releases know <em>exactly</em> what is in them,
amateur releases _do not_. &quot;Write better globs&quot; is the response I
often hear. I consider myself and the people I work with to be rather smart
people and if we get them wrong, chances are you will too. How many times
have you peered under the covers and seen .DS_Store, emacs backup~ files,
vim vm files and other files completely unrelated to the package? I have
far more times than I&#8216;d like.
</p>
<h3>VERSION</h3>
<p>
Releases have versions and I&#8216;ve found it best for the version to be
part of the code. You can use this during runtime in a multitude of ways.
<a href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> finds your version and uses it
automatically during packaging.
</p>
<h3>Releasing in 1 easy step</h3>
<pre>
  % rake release VERSION=x.y.z
</pre>
<p>
That really is all there is to it. Behind the scenes it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Branches the release in our perforce server. (via hoe-seattlerb plugin)

</li>
<li>Performs sanity checks to ensure the release has integrity. (hoe-seattlerb)

</li>
<li>Packages into gem and tarballs.

</li>
<li>Uploads the packages to rubyforge.

</li>
<li>Posts news of the release to rubyforge and my blog.

</li>
<li>Sends an announcement email. (hoe-seattlerb)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
That `VERSION=x.y.z` is there as a last-chance sanity check that you know
what you&#8216;re releasing. You&#8216;d be surprised how blurry
eyed/brained you get at 3AM. This check helps a lot more than it should.
</p>
<h2>Plugins:</h2>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> has a flexible plugin system that
allows you to activate and deactivate what tasks are available on a given
project. <a href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> has been broken up into
plugins partially to make maintenance easier but also to make it easier to
turn off or replace code you don&#8216;t want.
</p>
<ul>
<li>To activate a plugin, add the following to your Rakefile above your <a
href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> spec:

<pre>
  Hoe.plugin :plugin_name
</pre>
</li>
<li>To deactivate a plugin, remove its name from the plugins array:

<pre>
  Hoe.plugins.delete :plugin_name
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Again, this must be done before the <a href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a>
spec, or it won&#8216;t be useful.
</p>
<h3>Plug-ins Provided:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hoe::Clean

</li>

</ul>
<h3>Known 3rd-Party Plugins:</h3>
<ul>

</li>
<li>Hoe::Doofus - release checklist.

</li>
<li>Hoe::Debugging - for extensions, run your tests with GDB and Valgrind

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Writing Plugins:</h3>
<p>
A plugin can be as simple as:
</p>
<pre>
    module Hoe::Thingy
      attr_accessor :thingy

      def initialize_thingy # optional
        self.thingy = 42
      end

      def define_thingy_tasks
        task :thingy do
          puts thingy
        end
      end
    end
</pre>
<p>
Not terribly useful, but you get the idea. This example exercises both
plugin methods (initialize_#{plugin} and define_#{plugin}_tasks and adds an
accessor method to the <a href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> instance.
</p>
<h3>How Plugins Work</h3>
<p>
<a href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> plugins are made to be as simple as
possible, but no simpler. They are modules defined in the `<a
href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a>` namespace and have only one required
method (`define_#{plugin}_tasks`) and one optional method
(`initialize_#{plugin}`). Plugins can also define their own methods and
they&#8216;ll be available as instance methods to your hoe-spec. Plugins
have 4 simple phases:
</p>
<h4>Loading</h4>
<p>
When <a href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> is loaded the last thing it does
is to ask rubygems for all of its plugins. Plugins are found by finding all
files matching &quot;hoe/*.rb&quot; via installed gems or `$LOAD_PATH`. All
found files are then loaded.
</p>
<h4>Activation</h4>
<p>
All of the plugins that ship with hoe are activated by default. This is
because they&#8216;re providing the same functionality that the previous <a
href="../classes/Hoe.html">Hoe</a> was and without them, it&#8216;d be
rather useless. Other plugins should be &quot;opt-in&quot; and are
activated by:
</p>
<pre>
    Hoe::plugin :thingy
</pre>
<p>
Put this <em>above</em> your hoe-spec. All it does is add `:thingy` to `<a
href="../classes/Hoe.html#M000161">Hoe.plugins</a>`. You could also
deactivate a plugin by removing it from `<a
href="../classes/Hoe.html#M000161">Hoe.plugins</a>` although that
shouldn&#8216;t be necessary for the most part.
</p>
<p>
Please note that it is *<b>not</b>* a good idea to have a plugin
you&#8216;re writing activate itself. Let developers opt-in, not opt-out.
Just because someone needs the `:thingy` plugin on one project
doesn&#8216;t mean they need them on <em>all</em> their projects.
</p>
<h4>Initialization</h4>
<p>
When your hoe-spec is instantiated, it extends itself all known plugin
modules. This adds the method bodies to the hoe-spec and allows for the
plugin to work as part of the spec itself. Once that is over, activated
plugins have their *<b>optional</b>* define `initialize_#{plugin}` methods
called. This lets them set needed instance variables to default values.
Finally, the hoe-spec block is evaluated so that project specific values
can override the defaults.
</p>
<h4>Task Definition</h4>
<p>
Finally, once the user&#8216;s hoe-spec has been evaluated, all activated
plugins have their `define_#{plugin}_tasks` method called. This method must
be defined and it is here that you&#8216;ll define all your tasks.
